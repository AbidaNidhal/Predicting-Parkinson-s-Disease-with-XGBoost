# Predicting-Parkinson-s-Disease-with-XGBoost
<br>
In this project, you’ll carefully analyze a dataset of 195 records to predict the likelihood of having Parkinson’s disease using an XGBBoost model.
<br>
Until now, Parkinson’s disease can neither be diagnosed nor treated. The doctor assesses the symptoms and decides based on the medical history. The idea of this project is to predict the risk of having the disease according to some attributes, such as the patient’s average vocal fundamental frequency. Those with a higher risk of developing Parkinson's will require constant medical attention and that will slow down the progression of symptoms, thus alleviating pain and suffering.

The objectives of this project are :
<br>
- Read and explore data
- Understand the relationship between different variables through visualization
- Carry out feature selection to determine the variables that are most related to the target output.
- Build a machine learning model
- Use metrics, such as accuracy and ROC curve, to evaluate the model’s performance.
- Save the trained model into a file to be used for future predictions.
